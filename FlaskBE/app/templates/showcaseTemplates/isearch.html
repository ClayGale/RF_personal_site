<h1> i-Search Kelowna Analytic Prototypes </h1>
<h2> Created for COSC 224 - Projects in Computer Science </h2>
<h2> Team Project With Brett Steck, Dakota Moore, and William Paul </h2>

<p>
	For our capstone project in COSC224 we worked with Professor Kerry Rempel.
	She was working with a team to develop <a href="https://isearchkelowna.ca/"> i-Search Kelowna, </a>
	a website serving kelowna with a searchable map of housing resourses for at-risk and low-income individuals.
	We worked to develop several graph based data analysis prototypes for 
	their internal use and possible future development.
</p>
<p>
	Some of the prototypes we developed used real data that was provided to us. It provided invaluable 
	experience working within odd constraints to deliver an end-product
